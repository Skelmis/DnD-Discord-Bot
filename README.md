# A simple, yet intuitive DnD bot.

This bot was created to help handle a Dnd club over discord, the bot features fleshed out commands which can be viewed in the help.txt document or by running the help command in discord. This project was one of my first ones, and as such the code is not as efficient as it possibly should be, however it worked for my clients needs.
